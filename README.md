## Introduction

This project consists of a sole function named `r468`. The function takes a frequency value and returns a weighted gain value. For weightening, the [ITU-R BS.468-4](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I/en) standard and the [SMPTE RP 2054:2010](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7290513) recommended practice are followed. The returned gain value is implicitly returned as a weighted gain value in dB, but can explicitly be returned as a weighted gain factor.

The math for this project is taken from Wikipedia (as of 2019-08-08):

## Example Usage

```
from itu_r_468_weighting.filter import r468

r468(1000, "1khz")          # returns gain in dB
r468(1000, "2khz")          # returns gain in dB
r468(1000, "1khz", "db")    # returns gain in dB
r468(1000, "2khz", "db")    # returns gain in dB
r468(1000, "1khz", "norm")  # returns gain factor
r468(1000, "2khz", "norm")  # returns gain factor
```
