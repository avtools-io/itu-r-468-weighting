# DB_TOLERANCE was determined by taking the maximum value of the difference
# between computed ("1khz" and "2khz" option) and expected ITU-R 468 values.
# If the r468 function improves over time, this constant should converge to 0.
DB_TOLERANCE = 0.07184434988229427

# DB_GAIN_1KHZ was first determined with the multiplication factor of 8.1333
# (+18.20533583440004 dB). From there on the value was modified to find
# a better one, by converging the distance to 0 at 1000 and 125000 Hz.
# If the r468 function improves over time, this constant could change.
DB_GAIN_1KHZ = 18.246265068039158

# DB_GAIN_2KHZ was determined by substracting the dB Value at 2000 Hz from
# the "1khz" result of the constant DB_GAIN_1KHZ, plus adding the value
# at 1000 Hz from the "1khz" result to the constant of DB_GAIN_1KHZ.
# If the r468 function improves over time, this constant could change.
DB_GAIN_2KHZ = 12.617052124255618
